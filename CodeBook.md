Final table created by the scripr contains a table with this data set:
Subject: An integer that represents an individual (subject)
Activity: An string with the name of the activity performed by the subject during data collection
Other columns: the mean of each variable measurement grouped by "subject" and "activity"

A Complete description of variables is found in "features_info.txt" file contained in this .zip:
